/**
 * How a catalogue widget draws: Flash's `CatalogWidget` owns a container of the page's window
 * (`_window`) - the element `CatalogPage.createWidget` found by name - and either builds its own view
 * into it (`attachWidgetView(widgetId)`: `buildFromXML(getAssetByName(widgetId))` added as the
 * container's child) or, when the container is tagged `EMBEDDED`, binds the page layout's own
 * elements inside it.
 *
 * A widget component here renders nothing. It says what it does to its container - a
 * `CatalogWidgetView` - with `useCatalogWidgetView`, and `CatalogPageView` draws the page's template
 * with every widget's view applied in its container. `template` is the asset `attachWidgetView`
 * loads; its bindings and `arrange` then resolve inside it. Without one, or in an `EMBEDDED`
 * container, they resolve inside the container.
