 * (`ecotronbox_card_btn_open`) and close (`ecotronbox_card_btn_close`) buttons. Opening is a plain
 * use, and the prize arrives as an inventory update.
 *
 * Flash hides the open button from anyone who is neither the room's owner nor a controller of any
 * room (`setOpenButton`), and after the open shows the prize's icon in `ecotronbox_card_preview` and

 * open, so neither is drawn here.
