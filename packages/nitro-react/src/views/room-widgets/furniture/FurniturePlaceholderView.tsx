 * The stand-in for furniture whose real dialog was never built: `PlaceholderView`, drawn from the
 * `placeholder` layout (`ph_frame`, 250x150). Its two lines are written into the Flash layout in
 * English rather than localised (`ph_frame` and `ph_msg` captions, no `${...}` key), so the port
 * shows the same literal text - there is no key for a hotel to translate.
 *
 * `PlaceholderView.createWindow` builds it into a container at (-300, 300), and `showWindow` moves
 * that to x 200; the frame's `close`-tagged button hides it (`onWindowClose`).
