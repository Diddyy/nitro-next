/**
 * The infostand's place more button - Flash's `InfoStandWidget.requestItemToMover` and

 * builders club offer (`bcOfferId`). The ghost goes into the room as the infostand's
 * (`initializeRoomObjectInsert("info_stand", -bcOfferId, ...)`), and each drop in the room sends
 * `BuildersClubPlaceRoomItem` / `BuildersClubPlaceWallItem` for page -1 and starts the next one, so
 * the user keeps placing until they cancel. A drop off the room places nothing and ends it.
 *
 * Flash asks for the repeated placement (`initializeRoomObjectInsert`'s last argument), which keeps
 * a floor furni's direction from one drop to the next; the port's room placement has no repeated
 * placement, so each ghost starts at its default direction (as the catalogue's do).
