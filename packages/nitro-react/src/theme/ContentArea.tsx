                 * navigator's `white_background` (`x="-2" y="-5"`) covers the frame's two edge
                 * columns on each side at the rows just under the title bar, where the frame's own
                 * art is still the tinted top slice - blue, then its dark line. Only content can
                 * put white there. Lower down both the band and the frame's `center_left` are
                 * white, so those rows prove nothing either way; this pair of rows is the evidence.
                 *
                 * Cropping at this box instead leaves that dark line showing at the sides and cuts
                 * the tabs' tops; leaving it uncropped lets the room settings' `tab_context` at
                 * `x="-6"` hang outside the window. Both were tried.
